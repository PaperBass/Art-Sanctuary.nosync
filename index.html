            <h1>Louisville music community turns to live streaming during coronavirus pandemic</h1>
            <p>Grandma’s Boys, a Louisville rock band, play on a stage complete with multicolor lighting, fog and a booming sound system that reverberates off the concrete walls creating a wave of indiscernible sound.</p>
            <p>Operations officer Frankie Steele said it sounds better when there’s an audience.</p>
            <p>With a little tweaking of the sound controls, Steele has the band sounding great and ready to broadcast live. Despite the awkwardness of playing without an in-person audience, the band is just happy to be able to play to anyone again, wherever they might be.</p>

          <h3>COVID-19 encouraged a transition to online</h3>
            <div class="body">
              <p>The coronavirus pandemic shut down music venues in Louisville and around the world, Art Sanctuary saw a need to provide a safe space for musicians to continue to perform. “Late For Dinner” is a weekly concert live stream series hosted by Jeff Jobson at Art Sanctuary and streamed on YouTube.</p>
              <p>A crew made mostly of volunteers dedicate their Friday nights to help create the Late For Dinner experience. Bands often play to an audience of no one but the crew and the other artists on the bill in a room built for 600 people. </p>
              <p>Music live streams saw a massive increase last year. Bands canceled tours and instead turned to their computers and phones to play for their followers on social media.</p>
              <p>Many industries were stifled by COVID-19 yet the music industry saw a continued increase in sales and a 13% increase in <a href="https://riaa.medium.com/no-ordinary-year-2020-in-review-e00f3a16c5c7" target="blank">streaming revenues</a>. <a href="https://artists.bandsintown.com/support/blog/bandsintown-releases-data-report-on-live-streaming-attitudes-amongst-fans-artists" target="_blank">Bandsintown.com</a> reported a 40% increase in concert live stream participation among audiences.</p>
              <p>Twitch, the streaming platform primarily used for gamers, was adopted by artists to stream intimate musical performances and interact with their fans. Between March and April 2020, <a href="https://twitchtracker.com/games/26936" target="_blank">Twitch’s</a> music category nearly doubled in viewership and Twitch music channels increased by 59%.</p>

          <h3>“Late For Dinner” is born</h3>
            <div class="body">
              <p>Art Sanctuary is a non-profit and relies on rented studio space and donations for support. This put the studio in a unique position to provide free concert streams and create a much-needed outlet for musicians.</p>
              <p>Lisa Frye, board president and founder of Art Sanctuary, sat down with Steele and Jobson last year to brainstorm how to provide entertainment and keep busy during the lockdowns. They realized the facility’s potential to host concert live streams that go beyond simply putting the band in front of a camera.</p>
              <p> “There is a big difference between playing in your practice space and actually getting up on a stage,” Jobson said. “We have the facilities here. Frankie knew how to get the band sound up and we had a great video crew, so everybody looked great. Once some of the technical details were out of the way, then we got going on it and really haven't stopped.”</p>
              <p>Jobson worked with the University of Louisville’s Louisville Underground Music Archive (LUMA) project before the pandemic He recorded audio at live shows around town and helped categorize the archives. He said the benefit of doing a live stream is the ability to record and preserve the music which he sees is as an extension of the LUMA project in some ways.</p>
              <p>“This is going to be an interesting era as far as the archives go because this is a period where everything ground to a halt and not voluntarily,” Jobson said. “So this is kind of the one document of this particular year.”</p>
              <p>The road to nearly a year of weekly live streams wasn’t easy, though. Jobson said there were technical hurdles to jump and Late For Dinner faced censorship from YouTube.</p>
              <p>Steele told the story of when Brain Gray, a volunteer cameraman for Late For Dinner and musician, played with his band and YouTube flagged the stream for copyright infringement on his own music.</p>
              <p>“There was no way for me to tell YouTube, by the way it's his copyright,” Steele said. “I had to go in and dispute it and it took 2 weeks for them to get back to me and say, ‘yeah OK.’”</p>
              <p>Because of YouTube’s strict copyright protection policies, Steele doesn’t play house music. They once had a DJ play between music sets but when a Jay-Z song came on, the stream was removed as soon as it ended.</p>
              <p>“They really need to update the copyright laws around live streaming, “ Steele said.  “There needs to be a license that I can pay for through ASCAP to do live streaming.”</p>
              <p>According to <a href="https://www.ascap.com/help/ascap-licensing" target="_blank">ASCAP</a>, if a venue is streaming through most popular sites like YouTube, Facebook or Twitch, the sites already have ASCAP licensing for streaming and no additional license is required of the venue.</p>

          <h3>The future of live streaming</h3>
            <div class="body">
              <p>Hathor’s Fire is a music group consisting of Romana Bereneth and Tristen Brooke. They played for the April 2 Late For Dinner show but it wasn’t their first live-streaming experience.</p>
              <p>Bereneth said she got into the Lexington singer-songwriter series called Listen Locally one week before the pandemic forced the open mics to move to Zoom.</p>
              <p>“Whenever they do an open mic Zoom room… some people have great audio, some people have atrocious audio,” Bereneth said. “I'm pretty lo-fi [low fidelity]. It's just me and my boyfriend and our guitars and that's all.  We don't have mics or anything.”</p>
              <p>Both Bereneth and Brooke agree that having live streams available online to a wider audience is great, but it doesn’t compare to playing in front of an in-person audience.</p>
              <p>“You're putting all this energy out to someone with your music and in a live setting you get energy back from people and then you play with that energy,” Brooke said. “It's kind of exhausting to play to a computer.”</p>
              <p>Bereneth expressed concern about the effects live streaming might have on audiences.</p>
              <p>“As an audience member, you can get complacent,” Bereneth said. “You're like, ‘Oh! I’ll watch the replay,’ because how different is a live stream versus a replay anyhow?”</p>
              <p>She admitted to watching most Late For Dinner performances after the original live stream.</p>
              <!-- Video -->

              <p>Evan Harris, Ian Gordan, Noah Colston and Justin Deener make up Grandma’s Boys. They see live streams as a way to make concerts more accessible to people without the means or abilities to attend.</p>
              <p>Harris noted live streams make concerts accessible to dissabled people who can’t navigate through crowds or into wheelchair accessible venues.</p>
              <p>Gordan thinks if live streams continue, they will move away from recreating a typical live setting and present a more contained, intimate performance unique to the live stream.</p>
              <p>Jobson hopes to bring live audiences to Late For Dinner in June 2021 while still live streaming the show online. He thinks Late For Dinner gives Art Sanctuary the opportunity to continue to produce weekly performances for as long as possible.</p>
              <p>Steele imagines a world where bands will bring their own live streaming equipment similar to how they bring their own sound gear to create unique and consistent hybrid shows.</p>
              <p>One thing seems to be in consensus, live streams aren’t going anywhere. Bands and venues will have to adapt to the new normal as the music industry continues its rapid change in the digital age.</p>
